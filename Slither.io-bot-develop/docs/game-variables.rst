1. Game variables
*****************

.. note:: All the variable names (currently) mean something. For example, ``gsc`` means general scale, ``playing`` is literal, etc...

.. warning:: All the variable below are global, and should be accessed using ``window.<variable name>``

1.1 Scale variables
===================

1.1.1 ``gsc`` - Number
----------------------

The general scale variable. It is used to zoom in and out of the game, and to scale the game according to the player's size.
It defaults at :math:`0.9`.

1.1.2 ``csc`` - Number
----------------------

This is the scale variable used by the canvas, to convert screen coordinates to canvas ones. It doesn't have any default value.

1.2 State variables
===================

1.2.1 ``playing`` - Boolean
---------------------------

This variable tells wether the game has started or not.

1.3 Game elements, content variables
====================================

The title may not be clear, but these are variables containing a list of snakes, etc..., with game unit.

.. glossary::
    Game unit
        One of the units used by the bot. Please refer to :ref:`different-units-section`.

1.3.1 ``snake`` - Object
------------------------

This is the object corresponding to the player's snake. It contains a lot of useful informations (angle, coordinates, length, width, etc...).

.. note:: Its value is ``undefined`` if the game did not start yet.

1.3.1.1 ``snake.xx`` and ``snake.yy`` - Number
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

They are the coordinates of the snake, in Game unit.

1.3.1.2 ``snake.ang`` - Number
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the angle, *in radians*, at which the snake is going. It goes from :math:`0` to :math:`2\pi`.

1.3.1.3 ``snake.nk`` - String
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The nickname you choose on login screen. In case you forget...

1.3.1.4 ``snake.alive_amt`` - Number

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the snake scale, determining how big the snake is drawn.

1.3.2 ``snakes`` - Array of objects
-----------------------------------

This is an array containing nearby snakes, including yours. This means you cannot access all snakes to base a strategy upon. The content of each object is almost the same as in the ``snake`` object.
It may contain null or undefined objects.

.. note:: ``snakes[index].pts`` contains every components of the snake.

1.3.3 ``foods`` - Array of objects

An array containing the foods objects. each object has multiple keys:

1.3.3.1 ``foods[index].xx`` and ``foods[index].yy`` - Number
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In game unit, position of each food coordinate.

.. glossary::
    index
        Arbitrary or generated number to access the (n+1)th element of an array. For example, an index of 5 would access the sixth element of an array.

1.3.3.2 ``foods[index].sz`` - Number

Size of the food. Each food has a different size. This value can be used to sort foods according to their size.

1.3.4 ``preys`` - Array of objects

Contains every objects corresponding to a prey. Every object contains the coordinate of the prey under the keys ``xx`` and ``yy``.

They are the window size. They are dynamic read-only values.

1.4.3 ``xm`` and ``ym`` - Number
--------------------------------

They stand for 'x mouse' and 'y mouse' respectively. They are used to control the snake.

.. note:: It should be in mouse coordinates. Please refer to :ref:`different-units-section`

1.4.3 ``window.sector_size`` - Number
--------------------------------

This is the size of your snake vision (scope) in the game map. Used with ``bot.sectorBox``.

1.5 Game functions
==================

1.5.1 ``document.onkeydown``
----------------------------

This is a listener to keyboard press. Upon running the bot.user.js script, this funciton is saved as ``userInterface.original_keydown`` and then overridden to add more functionalities.

1.5.2 ``window.onmousedown``
----------------------------

This is a listener to mouse press. Upon running the bot.user.js script, this funciton is saved as ``userInterface.original_onmousedown`` and then overridden to add more functionalities.

1.5.3 ``window.onmousemove``
----------------------------

This is a listener to mouse cursor movement. Upon running the bot.user.js script, this funciton is saved as ``userInterface.original_onmousemove`` and then overridden to add more functionalities.

1.5.4 ``window.setAcceleration(x)``
-----------------------------------

This is the function used to accelerate your snake. When called with argument '1' snake will accelerate.
